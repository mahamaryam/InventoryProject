This is an Inventory Management System made entirely using C++, which keeps a track of all the items present in my university's inventory. You can add items to this 
inventory, delete, add and search for items. This system also keeps a record of the number of items allocated to university's facutly members. 
A textfile named as "projectfile.txt" serves as its database.
